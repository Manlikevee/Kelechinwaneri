It means our life is not a journey to be made or a target to be accomplished. It is just playful. It is also applied to art. It is never completed, it is not perfect, it is not worst or finished. It is just art and it is just playful.<br><br>I am an artwork in constant progress; I am my own canvas, my own colors, my own brushes, and my own inspiration. – Efrat Cybulkiewicz</body></html>
